# Simulated-Annealing-algorithm-in-local-search
The 8-Queens Problem using Simulated Annealing

The program utilizes a random initialization process to position the 8 queens on the chessboard. 

There are three settings for each of the following parameter combinations of temperature 𝑇, epochs 𝑒, and decay ratio 𝑑 to observe and analyze the outcome over the change in temperature.

To analyze the algorithm's behavior under different settings, the program is ran 10 times for each of the specified parameter combinations, then calculated an average time to convergence and success rate. The three settings are

Setting I: 𝑇 = 4000, 𝑒 = 10000, 𝑑 = 0.9

Setting II: 𝑇 = 2000, 𝑒 = 10000, 𝑑 = 0.9

Setting III: 𝑇 = 1000, 𝑒 = 10000, 𝑑 = 0.9

The following is the observed average time to convergence and success rate for each setting


Setting I: Average Time to Covergence = 15.5879,  Success Rate = 100 %

Setting II: Average Time to Covergence = 27.823,  Success Rate = 100 %

Setting III: Average Time to Covergence = 62.3011,  Success Rate = 100 %
